*This is totaly rework of Thwip server by bpepple to add import from comicrack xml file in the archive with option to update from comivvine using djano admin. With my  catalog of 1000s comics using ComicVine was taking way to long so I made this alternate importing . 






Thwip is a Django back-end that imports a comic-archive collection and retrieves the appropriate metadata from [Comic Vine](https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/), and provides a REST api that will allow you to read your comics. The React frontend can be found at [Thwip-Frontend](https://github.com/bpepple/thwip-frontend).

Goals, future roadmap and development installation instructions can be found over at the [wiki](https://github.com/bpepple/thwip/wiki).
